\viewkind4\uc1\pard\sb100\sa100\lang3081\f0\fs24 The genus \i Saccharipulvinaria\i0  Tao, Wong & Chang, 1983, was established with \i Pulvinaria iceryi\i0  Signoret as the type species. However, their illustration of the type species is clearly not \i P. iceryi\i0 , but of \i P. elongata\i0  Newstead (see William & Watson, 1990; Hodgson, 1994a). Until the exact status of \i Saccharipulvinaria\i0  will be evaluated, within a complete revision of the grass-inhabiting group of Pulvinariini species, the genus is here regarded a subjective synonym of \i Pulvinaria\i0 .

\viewkind4\uc1\pard\sb100\sa100\lang3081\f0\fs24 The genus \i Saccharipulvinaria\i0  Tao, Wong & Chang, 1983, was established with \i Pulvinaria iceryi\i0  Signoret as the type species. However, their illustration of the type species is clearly not \i P. iceryi\i0 , but of \i P. elongata\i0  Newstead (see William & Watson, 1990; Hodgson, 1994a). Until the exact status of \i Saccharipulvinaria\i0  will be evaluated, within a complete revision of the grass-inhabiting group of Pulvinariini species, the genus is here regarded a subjective synonym of \i Pulvinaria\i0 . - From ScaleNet June 2003
\par Previously Pulvinaria elongata was listed as a synonym, but it is a valid species of Pulvinaria - GRBrown
\par Also previously, Coccus takanoi was listed as a synonym, but it is a valid species of Coccus - GRBrown
